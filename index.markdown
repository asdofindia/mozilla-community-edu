## Learning, Teaching, Growing

Mozilla Community Education aims to empower Mozillians in their contributions, and personal goals through Education and Training.



> "..the core of the plan is the assumption that we need to build a virtuous circle between 
> 1) participation that helps our products and programs succeed and
> 2) people getting value from participating in Mozilla. ”
>      – [Mark Surman on Mozilla’s Participation Plan for 2015](https://commonspace.wordpress.com/2015/01/26/participationplan/)



> "Participation is when people contribute their energies, time and ideas to supporting Mozilla’s mission, programs and products. This can be volunteers contributing their ideas in a 
> brainstorm, or engaged users helping make products better, or supporters helping to increase 
> the reach of Mozilla's mission, programs and way of working.""

> Participation comes to life when both Mozilla and Mozillians (participants) get value.
