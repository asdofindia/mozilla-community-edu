persona_name: Coasting Coral
label:  Emerging leader, project fixture
persona_description: Coral has become a regular fixture in one part of the project, she frequents other areas - but ‘hangs her hat’ in one specific channel. She continues to be both challenged and engaged in her place of the project and  identifies as being both a team member of project, and part of the greater Mozillian community. <br><br> Coral is making significant impact through contribution and ideas.  She is at a key place in time, where she can lend to support to others, but needs to better develop her own skills, both project and inter-personal. Coral has become a bit more independent, has strongly held opinions about what works, and does not work  for participation in her area.
persona_belonging: Mozillian and project member
